Welcome to the companion CD-ROM for
Web Developer's Guide to VBScript & Javascript.

This CD-ROM contains all of the source code and other related files 
used in the book. Some of the products profiled are contained on the
CD-ROM Other products can easily be downloaded from the product
company’s web site.  Here is a description of the directories:

JSCRIPT  - Javascript demos from the book
VBSCRIPT - VBScript demos from the book
TOOLS    - Shareware applications to aid in development


Most of the applications in the TOOLS directory
are shareware, so it is up to you to make
sure that the authors of the program are
compensated if you decide to use their
program on an on going basis. Once again,
check the documentation files that are
related to the application you are using
to find out what the restrictions and
regulations are.

Finally, if you find software on this CD
that is useful to you, you may want to
check and see if there is a newer version
available. Many times, the authors of these
programs will include e-mail and Web site
addresses in the readme or help files. If
you have trouble finding any information
that way, here is a condensed list of some
of the best places to look on the Internet
for useful applications:
