A few people have been asking for a JS script to scroll a message only
once or a specified number of times. With the buggy and poorly-written
scrollIt script currently propagating throughout the web, I thought it was
time for a replacement. I added some comments to my JavaScript scroller,
and added some options to easily control repeat and delay times, so
hopefully this will fill the need.

If anyone has any comments on it, or can improve it further, by all means
speak up. Maybe we can start to get rid of those memory and time hogging
scroller scripts out there.

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"><!-- Insert this script in the HEADing of
your page.

// A BETTER SCROLLER - JavaScript Message Scroller
//  John Brochu (jbrochu@tiac.net)

// Feel free to use this script in your pages, but please include the
above lines.
// To start this script, just include the statement [ONLOAD="startMessage()"]
// (without the brackets) in your BODY statement.

//  This is meant to replace all those poorly-written, memory-hogging
//  scroller scripts out there clogging up the net. It is optimized
//  for speed and efficiency, as well as easy customization.

// The following lines should contain your message. There seems to be an
assignment
// limit of around 242 characters per string. So if your message is longer than
// that, you will need to split it into separate strings, and add
(concatenate) them
// to form one long string. You can add more strings if you have a longer
message,
// just make sure the "msg =" line includes all your strings.

var m1 = "Your message goes here. ";
var m2 = "Your message goes here. ";
var m3 = "Your message goes here. ";
var msg = m1+m2+m3;

// This is the pad string that positions your message in the status line.
The length
// of this string determines the initial starting position of your message. It
// should be large enough to begin the message off-screen, so that it
scrolls into
// view, but not large enough to cause a long delay before the user starts
to see
// it appear. You should change the "pad = " line, not the pad25 string.

var pad25 = "                         ";
var pad = pad25+pad25+pad25+pad25+pad25+pad25;

// The following are expressed in milliseconds (thousandths of a second)
var scrollDelay = 100;  // Controls the scrolling speed.
var initialDelay = 500; // Delay before beginning scroll after loading document.
var repeatDelay = 500;  // Delay before repeating message.

var repeatCount = 0;    // Times to repeat. (0 for one pass, -1 for continuous)

var scrollOffset = pad.length;
var offset;
var msgTimer = null;    

function startMessage()
{
    offset = scrollOffset;
    msgTimer = window.setTimeout("scrollMessage()", initialDelay);

{
    if ((offset <= scrollOffset) && (offset > 0)) {
        window.status = pad.substring(0, offset) + msg;
        offset--;
        msgTimer = window.setTimeout("scrollMessage()", scrollDelay);
    }
    else if (offset <= 0) {
        if (-offset < msg.length) {
