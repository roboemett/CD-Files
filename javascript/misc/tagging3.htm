Regarding discussions on UV usage, I got the following response from Robin
Wright of the USPS when I posed questions to him about UV. Robin is in
public relations and is not a technical expert but I would like to thank
him publically for trying:

1) First, we do have a specification for brightness of stamp paper.  The
USPS
specifications for stamp, as indicated in both our specification for gum
stamp
paper (USPS-P-1191) and our specifications for the regular self-adhesive
stamps
(USPS-P-1238), and for linerless stamps (USPS-S-1282) all specify a paper
brightness (for the print side) of 81 minimum when measured in accordance
with
TAPPI (The Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry) T452. 
The
reason this minimum brightness is specified is that it directly relates to
print
quality, specially when very high line screen printing (minimum 300 lines
per
inch or more) is required for most commemorative stamps printed by gravure
or
offset (lithography).
2) The second question concerns the appearance of the stamp taggant under
short
and long wave UV light.  The stamp phosphor taggant is activated only by
short
wave UV light at 254 NM (nanometers), when it glows as bright green with
an
emission of light centered at 525 NM.  This bright green color may appear
dull
green, or some other variation of green depending on the background, the
carrier
varnish in the case of post tagging, or other coatings on the paper in the
case
of prephosphor paper stamp paper.  At any rate, postal equipment that
detects
the phosphor signal such as the Model 2C phosphor meter or the advanced
facer
canceler system (AFCS) have the appropriate band pass filters to reject
extraneous signals and measure only the light emitted at 525 NM.  The
Postal
Specifications for stamp taggant require that the signal for red
fluorescent
signal at 615 NM shall not exceed 3 Postal Phosphor Meter Units (PMUs). 
The
long wave UV light usually detects fluorescent brighteners which are
present in
most commercially available paper but usually not in stamp paper.


I guess the first question for the group is if anyone has a copy of TAPPI
T452 test procedure (I am trying to get one but it would be easier if
someone already had it).
