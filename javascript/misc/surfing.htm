<h1>Surfing! </h1>

<h2>Art</h2>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Where would we be without art? Probably right here, but
we'd be bored and miserable a lot more often. </font></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1><a href="http://www.bahnhof.se/~secutor/ukiyo-e/index.html">Ukiyo-e</a>,
or Japanese woodblock prints, were discovered by the west when they were
crumpled up to use as packing for pottery being shipped to France. Now
they are a treasured art form.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.pennynet.org/glmuseum/corningm.htm">Corning
Museum of Glass</a> is even better in person, but their page is cool too.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.warhol.org/warhol/">Andy Warhol
Museum</a> is ... well, you had better just see for yourself!</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>New York's <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">Metropolitan
Museum of Art</a> is one of the world's premier art museums.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.norton.org/">Norton Museum of
Art</a> has nothing to do with Peter Norton (at least, I think it doesn't).</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.televisual.it/uffizi/">Uffizi
Gallery</a> in Florence, Italy is a great place to while away many happy
hours. There's great ice cream in Florence, too.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2>Various Fun Ways to Waste Time</h2>

<p><font SIZE=+1>We all do it. Here are some of my favorites.</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>Do you like auctions?&nbsp;Try the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/aw/">AuctionWeb</a>
for buying and selling most anything.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>If you're interested in things nautical, try the <a href="http://www.dot.gov/dotinfo/uscg/">Coast
Guard's</a> page.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Are you <i>really, truly</i> bored? Hop over to <a href="http://www.uroulette.com:8000/">URoulette</a>
to visit random pages.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>All the news that's fit to disseminate digitally? Try
the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/bin/login?Tag=/&URI=/yr/mo/day/index.html">New
York Times</a> page (and it won't fill up your recycling bin!).</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>
is one of those places that makes paying taxes a bit less unpleasant.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Want to buy a book? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/index2.html/1545-7038068-442711">Amazon.com</a>
almost surely has it.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>Want to torture yourself with beautiful pictures of exotic
places you can't visit? Try <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/">Conde
Nast Traveler</a>.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://update2.wsj.com/welcome.html">Wall
Street Journal</a> lets you see how that Netscape stock you didn't buy
is doing.</font></li>
</ul>

<h2>Search Engines</h2>

<p><font SIZE=+1>I know, I know. Everyone and their aunt has a list of
search engines on their page. So why should I be any different?</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>You might call <a href="http://www.search.com/">SEARCH.COM</a>
a meta-search engine. Rather than providing its own search capabilities,
it provides an interface to many different individual search sites. It's
easy to get confused here, but when nothing else works it's the place to
turn.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1><a href="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan</a> is different
from many other search sites. Rather than using an automated text or keyword
search. Magellan's staff of real people visit each site and review it.
Each site receives a one to four star quality rating, a green light symbol
if free of &quot;adult&quot; content, and a brief descriptive review. Because
of this approach, Magellan is more likely to miss relevant sites than some
other search engines, but the &quot;hits&quot; it returns will be real
hits and not the 90% moronic output of some of the computerize search methods.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> is perhaps
my favorite search engine. It seems to strike a good balance between thoroughness
and relevance. Yahoo's appeal is enhanced by its What's New, What's Cool,
Random Site, and Headlines links.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.albany.net/allinone/">All-In-1
</a>site takes a hierarchical subject-based approach to searching. You
work your way down from very general subject areas to more specific areas,
then are presented with an interface a collection of relevant search engines.
</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">WebCrawler</a>
is an automated index generator whose operation is well described by the
name. An <i>agent</i> automatically follows links on the web to any and
all documents it can find, and the text in those documents is indexed.
It is very thorough but dumb as a post. A search for &quot;Java,&quot;
for example, turned up not only a whole slew of sites on Java programmng
but also the URL of some organization that deals with coffee. </font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">Argus/University
of Michigan Clearinghouse</a> is best thought of as a guide to Internet
guides. Argus lists only Web sites that are themselves guides to Internet
sites or other resources dealing with a specific topic. If you want to
know where to look for information on aquatic biology, legislation dealing
with adoption, or Japanese woodblock prints, then Argus is just the place
to look. If you want to find pages dealing with &quot;Doom&quot; or &quot;sex&quot;
then you had better look elsewhere.</font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>The <a href="http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw.html">Open
Text Index</a> is another text indexing robot. It's a bit more flexible
than most because it lets you specify where in the target document the
text is found (URL, title, heading, summary, etc.) and to combine individual
searches with logical operators. For example, you could locate document
that have &quot;JavaScript&quot; in the title and &quot;verification&quot;
in the summary. </font></li>
</ul>
