<H1> Getting Started with <br>the Navigator Gold Editor</H1>
</A><p><hr><p><A NAME="1001664">
<img src="getstara.gif">ntil recently, creating Web pages was a time-consuming process of editing a file full of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) codes, viewing the page using a browser, going back to the source file to make changes, viewing it again, and so on until you're satisfied with the result. Navigator Gold makes creating and editing Web pages almost as easy as browsing them.<P>
</A><A NAME="1005316">
This chapter introduces the Navigator Gold editor and provides an overview of its features.<P>
</A><A NAME="998779">
<H2> About the Editor</H2>
</A><A NAME="1001865">
There are a lot of things you can do with the editor; here are a few:<P>
</A><ul><A NAME="1003257">
<LI>Work in a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) environment. You no longer need to understand the complexities of HTML to create your own Web content.
</A><A NAME="1007021">
<LI>Add, remove and modify text. Click on any part of a downloaded Web page and immediately work with text and images.
</A><A NAME="1007019">
<LI>Drag-and-Drop. Drag-and-drop hyperlinks and images from the Bookmarks, Mail, News, or browse windows, to a document in the editor. 
</A><A NAME="1005074">
<LI>Compose documents for a variety of uses. Create a new page for printing, saving, sending via electronic mail, publishing or posting to a news group or to a Web server.
</A><A NAME="1004961">
<LI>Format text to suit your needs. You can apply paragraph and character styles to text just as you would in your favorite word-processing application.
</A><A NAME="1005042">
<LI>Change font size and color. Use these features to create pages that focus a reader's attention where you want.
</A><A NAME="1005144">
<LI>Include objects in your pages. You can insert images, horizontal lines, and hyperlinks in the Web documents you create.
</A><A NAME="1005496">
<LI>Edit JavaScript statements. Include JavaScript in your documents. JavaScript is an open, cross-platform object scripting language for enterprise networks and the Internet.
</A></ul><A NAME="1003346">
<H2> Starting the Editor</H2>
</A><A NAME="1001918">
When you first start Navigator Gold, you are in a browse window or a view. Since Navigator Gold allows you to browse the World Wide Web and author your own Web pages, it's important to note that there are distinct windows depending on what task you want to do. For example, there are windows for accessing news groups and reading mail in addition to those for browsing and editing. <P>
</A><A NAME="1005827">
The browse and edit windows each have their own unique set of menu commands and toolbars designed with these distinct but allied purposes in mind. You can easily switch between browse and edit windows using commands from each window's File menu or toolbar.<P>

</a><A NAME="1005486">
There are several ways to begin an editing session depending on whether you want to create a new document (begin with a blank page or apply one of the templates), or edit a page you are currently browsing.<P>
</A><A NAME="1007396">
Editing a new page<P>
</A><A NAME="1003576">
<P>
</A><ul><A NAME="1002021">
<LI>Choose File|New Document
</A><A NAME="1003426">
An edit window opens containing a blank page. The original browse window 
remains open but behind the edit window.
<P>
</A><A NAME="1007437">
Editing the page you're browsing
<P>
</A><A NAME="1003403">
<LI>Click the Edit tool (pencil icon)
</A><A NAME="1003462">
The current browse window becomes an edit window containing the document you 
were viewing. Choosing File|Edit Document performs the same action.
<P>
</A><A NAME="1005697">
Editing an existing file
<P>
</A><A NAME="1007440">
<LI>Choose File|Open File in Editor
</A><A NAME="1005780">
An edit window opens containing the specified file. The original browse window 
remains open but behind the edit window.
<P>
</A><A NAME="1005844">
<B>The Editor Window<p><img src="editor.gif">
</B><P>
</A><A NAME="1006381">
You can configure some of the edit window components, as well as how certain text elements appear in the window. For example, you can display or hide the File|Edit, Paragraph Format, or Character Format toolbars, and specify the color for text, links, etc.. See the ??? chapter for information about customizing the editor.<P>
</A></ul><A NAME="1005845">
<H2> Things You Should Know </H2>
</A><A NAME="1003635">
The editor provides its own set of toolbar buttons for the most common editing tasks. It also allows various drag-and-drop operations. Before you begin, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with these time-saving features, as well as some important terms and concepts.<P>
</A><A NAME="1008045">
<H3> What We Really Mean by Web Pages</H3>
</A><A NAME="1008039">
Browsing Web pages and creating your own are very different things. For the former, you don't need to know about the components that make up a Web page, for the latter, you do. A Web page is not simply a document containing formatted text and some graphics, such as that produced using word-processing applications. A Web page is an HTML file:<P>
</A><ul><A NAME="1008049">
<LI>containing topics that can be linked to from other Web pages
</A><A NAME="1008063">
<LI>that may require scrolling in the browser window to view the entire "page."
</A><A NAME="1008064">
<LI>that can contain pointers to graphic files and multimedia objects
</A><A NAME="1008078">
<LI>that can be located on a server so that others may access your information
</A><A NAME="1008238">
When you browse the Web, most of the Web pages you view are part of an overall Web presentation consisting of one or more Web pages. These Web pages are (hopefully) linked together in a meaningful way to create an organized, consistent, and pleasing effect..<P>
</A><A NAME="1008242">

</A></ul><A NAME="1002497">
<H3> Some Useful Terms</H3>
</A><A NAME="1007647">
If you are accustomed to using the Navigator (or any other browser for that matter), you are probably already familiar with most of the following terms. However, if not, these definitions will help you as you begin the content creation process.<P>
</A><A NAME="1007681">
<B><p>
<img src="getstart.gif"></B><P>
</A><A NAME="1008004">
<H3> Using the Toolbars</H3>
</A><A NAME="1003930">
The three toolbars below the menus, File|Edit, Paragraph and Character Format, contain buttons corresponding to frequently used commands. You can access the toolbar commands from the menus, but it's generally quicker to use the toolbars. <P>
</A><A NAME="1003997">
<P>
</A><A NAME="1004002">
<B>File|Edit Toolbar
<p><img src="tb1.gif">
</B><P>
</A><A NAME="1003959">
<B>Paragraph Format Toolbar<p><img src="tb2.gif">
</B><P>
</A><A NAME="1006686">
<B>Character Format Toolbar
<p><img src="tb3.gif"></b><P>
</A><A NAME="1008491">
Just as in the browse window, you can change the appearance by choosing Options|General and specifying whether to display text, pictures, or text and pictures together. In addition, while in the editor, you can reposition a toolbar by dragging it to the area you want. The toolbar will snap into position.<P>
</A><A NAME="1008500">
<H3> Pop-up Menus</H3>
</A><A NAME="1008493">
Pop-up menus are a handy way to get to frequently used commands. What commands you can get to is completely dependent on where you are when you right-click. For example, right-clicking while on a link provides you with commands to copy or modify the link. If you right-click while on an image, you'll have quick access to commands to save the image under a new name or display its properties. <P>

</A><A NAME="1002323">
<H3> Drag and Drop</H3>
</A><A NAME="1004037">
Several drag-and-drop operations are available while using the editor. You can:<P>
</A><ul><A NAME="1007889">
<LI>Drag a link from a browse window and drop it in the edit window. This is just like inserting a link in the document you're editing.
</A><A NAME="1007932">
<LI>Drag a link from a Bookmarks, Mail, or News window and drop it in the edit window.
</A><A NAME="1007959">
<LI>Drag an image from a browse window and drop it in the edit window. This is the easiest way to add images to your Web pages.
