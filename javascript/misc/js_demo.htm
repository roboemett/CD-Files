<h1>Coriolis Group JavaScript Demo Page </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Remember that JavaScript is a language still under development.
The language itself, and its implementation in various browsers, is not
yet standardized. As a result you cannot expect every script to work the
same, or to work properly at all, in every browser/platform combination.
Even so, most scripts usually work fine so try them out and have fun!</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font SIZE=+1>A <a href="rpn_calc.htm">calculator</a> seems to be everyone's
first JavaScript project. There are dozens of them out there on the web,
so I thought I might as well add to the pile. I did things a bit diferently
however, implementing a reverse Polish notation (RPN, also called postfix
notation) calculator instead of the algebraic type you usually see. </font></li>

<li><font SIZE=+1>A <a href="clockcal.htm">clock/calendar</a> combination
is a good demonstration of using JavaScript to generate HTML documents
on the fly. It demonstrates use of the timer and some HTML table stuff,
too.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE=+1>There's more coming!</font></p>
