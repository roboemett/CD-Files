There are several things to keep in mind. Topmost is that all UV lamps differ. For luminescence 
you need a shortwave lamp, but some also provide so much unwanted longwave light to be almost 
useless.
The Plate Number Coil Study Group, to which you used to belong, did some comparisons on this. The 
best light for shortwave was found to be the Scott lamp, which also has the advantage of having a 
hood, meaning that it can be placed on the stamp and let in no room light.
Somw other lamps were found to be almost useless. One was the original Lighthouse shortwave lamp. 
When we informed Lighthouse of our finding, Lighthouse quickly produced a filter (which costs more 
than the Lighthouse lamp itself). But with the filter, the Lighthouse portable shortwave lamp (I 
sell them at 15% off list) became the best shortwave UV lamp, better than the Raytech and several 
other models we tested.
An example of this arose just this week.
The 1¢ Omnibus coil from Plate 3 has been found tagged in error. Dr. Robert Rabinowitz finally 
found some, but they were so weakly tagged that they hardly showed their tagging under his lamp. 
He called me to compare notes.
Did the stamp glow as brightly as the tagged-in-error 10¢ Eagle and Shield? Mine was brighter.
Today, Al Haake told me that Dr. Bob's stamps glowed under a Lighthouse with filter but did not 
glow at all under a Scott.
So you see, it's not possible to set up terminology when all lights differ.
The same sort of thing happens with fluorescence (longwave UV), I discovered many varieties in the 
1960s of Geman stamps, but the Michel catalog never listed them because no two collectors could 
see the same thing.
