I have been interested in the use of UV to check stamps for over 25
years. Canadian stamps have used tagging since the early 60's. Since the
early tagging was always observable to the naked eye, I didn't bother
with UV. However, I then found out that UV could be used not only for
tagging, but also to identify different types of paper and ink. It can
lead to interesting new areas of research, even for experts. 

For example, last night I visited Hans Reiche, an expert in the field of
the Canadian Admirals issue. He has studied this issue for over 50 years
and has published a number of philatelic books in this and other areas.
He was amazed when I showed him the tremendous variety of ink
flourescence that could be observed on the 2 cent (red) issues (sheet
stamps, coils, war tax, booklets).  

In the time that I have been following posts on rec.collecting.stamps, I
have seen almost no mention of UV use in philately. I, too, would like
to see more posts on this topic. In Canada, the specialized catalogues
do refer to flourescent paper varieties and numerous articles have been
published in The Canadian Stamp News. Various authors have tried to
establish methods of identifying and quantifying their findings to
relate to others, but I have have found all of them to be incomplete.
More paper and ink varieties exist than I have found in any catalog.

Collectors in the U.S. (and other countries) also have an abundance of
paper (and tagging) varities to examine. In searching through U.S.
kiloware, I have come across a number of definitives that have been
produced on very bright flourescent paper (whereas the common issue is
on very dull paper). A number of years ago, I received mail on 2
consecutive days from the same source in Mexico, with the same stamp
issue, but one was dull flourescent and the other was very bright. 

For those of you who have never experienced the use of UV on stamps, it
can open up a whole new world to you. Please let us know your findings.

Caution: Paper and ink variety studies should use long wave UV only (an
18 inch flourescent black light works great). Tagging for many
countries, such as Canada, can be studied with long wave only. However,
short wave UV (much more dangerous to the eyes) is needed to study
tagging on some, but not all, issues of countries such as the U.S. and
Britain.

Have fun,
